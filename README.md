## Economic Statisics Repository 

This repository contains classwork in data analysis and methods produced in R over the course of the semester. Our final project was a replication of the research findings from Jensen and Miller's seminal paper, "Giffen Behavior and Subsistence Consumption," published in the American Economic Review. These projects were completed as part of a class assignment and include the following components:

Data Tables: Recreated data tables from Jensen and Miller, Cengage Statisics for Buisness and Economics Datasets
R Code: Scripts written in R to replicate the analysis and findings of the study.

Documentation: Documentation explaining each step of the replication process, including data sources, code explanations, and interpretation of results.
