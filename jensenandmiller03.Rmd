Jensen and Miller's report:
The main contribution from Jensen and Miller's report is the identification of real-life Giffen goods
and how they interact with the societies in our world. Initially, Giffen goods seem to break the law
of demand but as a result of this paper, things seem to be less concrete than thought before.

 In Project 01 we replicated Panel A and Panel B of Table 1- "Means and Standard Deviations of Key variables. A significant finding is that the consumption of wheat is much lower per person on average, but Gansu has almost exactly a different pattern. with wheat-based foods are dominant.

In project 02 we ran regression for our data sets, which allowed us to then run an F and T-test for the overall validity, and variable significance of our model.

Hunan notes b0 = -0.459 b1 = -0.095 std error (sb1) = 0.081 std error (sbo) = 1.36794 t = b1 / sb1 = -1.171
dof > 1000 (1256) can consider this t-test a normal distribution p = (0.242) > 0.05
we cannot reject the null we do not have enough evidence to prove that the data is statistically significant
gansu notes b0 = -28.6038 b1 = -0.4089
std error (sb0) = 1.36 std error (sb1) = 0.08 t = b1 / sb1 = 3.054 p = (0.0023) < 0.05
we reject the null, we have enough evidence to prove the data is statistically significant

We estimate the elasticity of Gansu positive because the coefficient of regression is not statistically significant.
